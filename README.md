# LibraryManagerOOP-Java

A simple and effective **Library Management System** created using Java. This project showcases the use of core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and is operated through a console-based menu system.

## 📚 Features
- Add books to the library
- View all books
- Issue books by ID
- Return books by ID

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Java
- VS Code
- Terminal (Command Line)

## 👩‍🏫 OOP Concepts Used
- **Abstraction**: Hiding details and showing essential features
- **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and methods in a single unit
- **Inheritance**: Code reusability using parent-child class relationships
- **Polymorphism**: Performing a single action in different ways

## 📦 Java Classes Overview
- `Book` → Represents a book object with title, author, ID, and issued status
- `User` → Represents a library user (can be extended in future versions)
- `Library` → Manages book collection, issue/return functions
- `Main` → Main class that runs the console menu system

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
javac *.java
java Main

```
